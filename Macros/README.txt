# Macros

This folder contains the macro files used in the *Mastering Excel for Home Budgeting* book.

There are two subfolders:
- **Excel_VBA/** â€” Macros written for Microsoft Excel using VBA.
- **LibreOffice_BASIC/** â€” Macros adapted for LibreOffice Calc using LibreOffice BASIC.

ðŸ“¢ Note:
- If you are using **Microsoft Excel**, use the macros inside the `Excel_VBA` folder.
- If you are using **LibreOffice Calc**, use the macros inside the `LibreOffice_BASIC` folder.

Macros are optional. You can also complete macro-driven steps manually by following the bookâ€™s instructions.
